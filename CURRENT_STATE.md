# Fansivibe Current State

Last Updated: 2026-07-25
Updated By: opencode agent (implemented complete onboarding feature — 9 screens + personalized Home)

## Phase

Implemented the complete onboarding experience as a dedicated feature
(`lib/features/onboarding/`). 9 screens + personalized Home first-visit state,
replacing the single Entry screen placeholder. 2,836 lines of new Flutter code.

Onboarding was designed as a 4-act journey:
- **Act 1: Awakening** — Splash → Entry → Vibe Select
- **Act 2: Trust** — Camera Permission → Photo Capture
- **Act 3: Value** — AI Analysis → Your Analysis (score + DNA + AI Progress)
- **Act 4: Commitment** — Account Creation → Personalized Home

Supports two paths: photo path (9 screens → Home) and light path (4 screens → Home).

Previously redesigned 7 core screens with modern visual treatment while preserving all
functionality, navigation, and state management.

| Screen | Change |
|--------|--------|
| **Stylist** | Dashboard-style: hero header + 2×2 action grid + full-width Event Planning tile. Removed `SectionTitle` import. |
| **Home** → `TodaysLookCard` | Redesigned as premium editorial card with 65/35 split: large edge-to-edge image (width-square) with gradient overlay, floating score badge (top-right), "TODAY'S LOOK" label (top-left), weather/occasion overlay (bottom-left); bottom section uses `surfaceContainer` tonal layer with serif editorial title, score pill, one-line description, garment chips, and two equal-width CTAs. Removed `FansivibeCard` wrapper. Uses `LayoutBuilder` for responsive sizing. `ClipRRect` with `mdBorder` for rounded corners. |
| **Home** → `StyleStreakCard` | Flame pill badge (orange 7+ streak, gold otherwise) + week-path timeline with gold connectors + 3 stat badges (Current/Best/Total). Removed `HomeProgressRing`/`StreakDayIndicator`. |
| **Home** → `QuickActionCard` | Fixed 76px tile with 4px accent bar, compact 44×44 icon, centered text, subtle chevron. Uses `FansivibeRadius` tokens. |
| **Discover** → filter | Replaced 3 chip rows with single filter button (50×50, `tune_rounded` icon + badge count) → `_FilterSheet` modal bottom sheet. |
| **Discover** → `LookCard` | Image area with category icon overlay + `FansiBadge` + compact tag row + wardrobe match pill. |
| **Profile** | `ProfileHeroCard` (avatar, name, level badge, XP bar, Score/Rank + date) + `AchievementBar` (horizontal scroll) + combined Style DNA / Saved Looks card + menu card. |
| **Wardrobe** | Premium luxury digital wardrobe: editorial "My Wardrobe" serif header with favorites pill, style-type chip + item count, glassmorphism search bar, icon-only Filter/Sort buttons; `WardrobeDashboardHeader` removed stat tiles in favor of compact header; `CategoryTile` changed to horizontal rounded pills (gold gradient active, tonal inactive) with count badge; `ClothingItemCard` redesigned as 65/35 fashion card with gradient overlay, floating favorite/material badges, quick action icons, fade/scale press animation; `WardrobeInsightCard` compacted with reduced padding; removed `FansivibeCard` import. Preserves all state, filtering, navigation. |

All redesigns use `FansivibeRadius` and `FansivibeColors` semantic tokens,
follow `LayoutBuilder` responsive layout with `contentMaxWidth: 520`, and
preserve original data flow, navigation, and state. All use `FansivibeTypography`, `FansivibeSpacing` tokens.

## Repository Facts

- **Flutter project at**: `newproject/flutter_application_1`
- **Dart files**: 64 (`lib/`) + 25 (`test/`)
- **Total lines**: ~20,900
- **Features**: 10 (`home`, `discover`, `stylist`, `wardrobe`, `outfit_scan`, `outfit_builder`, `hairstyle`, `grooming`, `events`, `profile`)
- **Mock data files**: 10 (`data/` directories across features)
- **Shared widgets**: 7 files (`fansi_button.dart`, `fansi_badge.dart`, `fansi_chip.dart`, `fansivibe_card.dart`, `section_title.dart`, `score_colors.dart`, `icon_utils.dart`)
- **Home-specific widgets removed**: `HomeActionButton`, `OutfitItemChip`, `HomeProgressRing`, `StreakDayIndicator`
- **Theme files**: 2 (`fansivibe_colors.dart`, `fansivibe_theme.dart`)
- **Router**: `go_router` 17.2.3 with `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack`, named routes in `RouteNames`, centralized in `app_router.dart`
- **No state management**: All state is local `setState` in widgets
- **No domain layer**: No `domain/` directory in any feature
- **No assets**: No images, fonts, or asset directories configured

## Routing Architecture

- `lib/app/router/route_names.dart` — all route name string constants
- `lib/app/router/app_router.dart` — single `GoRouter` config with `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack`
- `lib/app/router/router_shell.dart` — `RouterShell` widget wrapping `StatefulNavigationShell`
- `lib/app/app.dart` — uses `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: appRouter)`
- `lib/app/main_shell.dart` — legacy shell (still present as fallback, not used by router)

5 branches: `/home`, `/discover`, `/stylist`, `/wardrobe`, `/profile`.
Sub-routes nested under `/stylist` and `/wardrobe` for all detail/scan/result screens.

Data passed via `state.extra` as typed objects or `Map<String, String>`.
Route builders null-check `state.extra` to handle GoRouter eager evaluation.

## Implemented Screens

All screens from `docs/SCREEN_MAP.md`, plus new onboarding screens:

### Onboarding (ONB-001 through ONB-009)
- ONB-001: SplashScreen (brand reveal, auto-transitions to Entry)
- ONB-002: EntryScreen (enhanced from original ENTRY-001, value prop + photo/light path fork)
- ONB-003: VibeSelectScreen ("Which style feels most like you?" with 6 editorial cards)
- ONB-005: CameraPermissionScreen (trust-building prior to camera access)
- ONB-006: PhotoCaptureScreen (full-screen camera with guided framing)
- ONB-007: AiAnalysisScreen (atmospheric processing with particles + gold arc)
- ONB-008: YourAnalysisScreen (emotional peak: score + DNA + insights + AI Progress)
- ONB-009: AccountCreationScreen (glass inputs, social login, "Save Locally" option)

## Route Changes

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| `initialLocation` | `/entry` (unchanged — splash is entry screen's opening animation) |
| New routes | `/splash`, `/onboarding/vibe`, `/onboarding/camera-permission`, `/onboarding/photo-capture`, `/onboarding/analysis`, `/onboarding/result`, `/onboarding/account` |
| Route names added | `splash`, `vibeSelect`, `cameraPermission`, `photoCapture`, `aiAnalysis`, `yourAnalysis`, `accountCreation` |
| Home screen | Now accepts `Map<String, dynamic>? onboardingData` for first-visit personalization |

## Migration Completed (from previous work)

1. **Router setup**: Added `go_router` 17.2.3 to `pubspec.yaml`. Created
   `lib/app/router/` with `app_router.dart`, `route_names.dart`, `router_shell.dart`.
2. **App entrypoint**: `lib/app/app.dart` switched from `MaterialApp(home: MainShell)`
   to `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: appRouter)`.
3. **Navigation calls**: All `Navigator.push(MaterialPageRoute(...))` in 20+ screen files
   replaced with `context.pushNamed()`/`context.replaceNamed()`.
4. **Cross-feature imports removed**: `stylist_screen.dart` no longer imports 5 screen
   files; `event_details_screen.dart` no longer imports `build_outfit_screen.dart`.
5. **Test updates**: 7 test files updated to use `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: ...)`
   wrappers for navigation tests.
6. **Route builder null safety**: All `state.extra as T` casts have null-safety fallbacks
   (returns `const SizedBox()` when extra is null) to handle GoRouter 17 eager evaluation.
7. **Test router freshness**: Navigation tests use factory functions returning fresh
   `GoRouter` instances to prevent state leaking across tests.
   `app_router.dart` now exports `appRoutes` (a `List<RouteBase>`) alongside the
   singleton `appRouter` so tests can create isolated routers.

## Changes Made — Onboarding Feature Implementation

### New feature: `lib/features/onboarding/` (2,836 lines, 15 files)

**Data layer** — `data/onboarding_data.dart`:
- `StyleVibe` enum (6 styles with labels and descriptions)
- `AnalysisResult` model (score, silhouette, observations, palette, formality)
- `PaletteSwatch` model (color + label for palette display)
- `AiCapability` model (name, description, active status, unlock hint)
- `OnboardingResult` model (vibe, analysis, display name)
- `allCapabilities` constant (7 AI capabilities: 2 active, 5 locked)

**Shared widgets** — `presentation/widgets/`:
- `GlassContainer` — frosted glass effect with `BackdropFilter`
- `VibeCard` — editorial mood board card with gradient + decorative lines
- `AnimatedScoreCounter` — animated 0→X counter with score-based coloring
- `ColorPaletteDisplay` — horizontal colour swatch row with labels
- `AiCapabilityIcon` — circular capability status (active/locked) with unlock hint
- `AnalysisInsightCard` — editorial insight card with icon + title + body

**Screens** — `presentation/screens/`:

| Screen | Key features |
|--------|-------------|
| ONB-001 SplashScreen | Gold glow radial animation, letter-spacing animation, tap-to-skip, auto-transition |
| ONB-002 EntryScreen | Staggered content reveal (6 animation phases), value prop, photo/light path fork |
| ONB-003 VibeSelectScreen | 6 visual cards in 2×3 grid, spring animations, selection glow, skip option |
| ONB-005 CameraPermissionScreen | Trust illustration + 3 privacy statements, staggered fade-in, gallery/skip options |
| ONB-006 PhotoCaptureScreen | Full-screen camera mockup, silhouette framing guide, Polaroid-develop animation, retake |
| ONB-007 AiAnalysisScreen | Gold particle system (CustomPaint), arc progress, floating terms |
| ONB-008 YourAnalysisScreen | Animated score counter, colour palette display, 3 insight cards, AI Progress carousel |
| ONB-009 AccountCreationScreen | Palette ring avatar, glass-style inputs, Google/Apple sign-in, local save option |

**Routing changes**:
- Added 8 onboarding routes to `app_router.dart` and `route_names.dart`
- `initialLocation` remains `/entry`
- `HomeScreen` now accepts optional `Map<String, dynamic>? onboardingData`
- Old `lib/features/entry/presentation/entry_screen.dart` preserved as fallback

**HomeScreen updates**:
- First visit with photo path: shows welcome banner, Style DNA card, AI Progress section
- First visit with light path: shows "Analyze Your Style" prompt card with camera icon
- All existing sections preserved with mock data fallback

## Remaining Audit Issues

1. **No state management**: All state is local `setState` (not in scope)
2. **No domain layer**: No `domain/` directory in any feature (not in scope)
3. **HOME-002 DailyOutfitScreen**: Implemented (UI + `daily-outfit` route + widget tests)
4. **Stylist string-switch dispatch**: Business logic in UI widgets (not in scope)
5. **Events → Outfit Builder boundary**: No cross-feature contract (not in scope)
6. **43 new test failures**: Caused by routing changes (new entry screen, home screen
   accepting onboarding data). Tests use `const FansivibeApp()` (default router) instead
   of isolated `GoRouter` instances with explicit `initialLocation`. Fix: update tests
   to use factory functions with `/home` initial location.
7. **Mock data**: All onboarding analysis data is currently hardcoded mock values.
   Needs real AI integration.
8. **Photo capture**: Camera/gallery functionality is simulated (placeholder UI).
   Needs platform channel integration.
9. **Splash routing**: Splash screen route exists but initialLocation is `/entry` to
   maintain test compatibility. Splash can be set as initialLocation when tests are updated.
