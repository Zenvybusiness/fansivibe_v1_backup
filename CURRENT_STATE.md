# Fansivibe Current State

Last Updated: 2026-08-01
Updated By: opencode agent (Value-first Entry screen redesign + returning-user account gate)

## Changes Made — Professional Entry Screen Redesign (edit)

### Modified: `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/screens/entry_screen.dart`

Replaced the over-decorated "atelier" treatment with a restrained, professional
first-launch screen. Removed competing decoration (viewfinder corners, aura
gauge, star field, glow orbs, diamond bullets) in favor of one focal point and
clear type hierarchy. All routes/behavior unchanged.

**Design changes:**
- **Wordmark**: clean two-line lockup — serif FANSIVIBE (26px, tracked) over
  gold "APPEARANCE INTELLIGENCE" label. Dropped the pill badge.
- **Mirror focal point** (new): single 148px breathing ring with soft radial
  glow and person glyph — the only decorative element, animated via a subtle
  `_breathController` (0.45→0.85 alpha, 2.8s easeInOut).
- **Headline**: "Your best style, / *discovered by AI.*" — italic gold
  second line; dropped the 3-line manifesto block.
- **Value statement**: one muted line "Look better. Dress smarter. Build
  confidence." in place of diamond bullets + verbose support copy.
- **CTA stack**: `Analyze My Style` (primary) + `Explore Without Scanning`
  (secondary) — now the clear visual anchor.
- **Account gate**: no card — hairline divider + "Already have a Fansivibe
  account?" + two equal ghost pills (`Sign In` / `Continue as New User`).
- **Privacy note**: lock + label retained, switched to `Wrap` to eliminate a
  26px RenderFlex overflow under large text scale.
- Motion: single clean fade+slide `_Reveal` (8–12px) stagger over 1200ms;
  `TickerProviderStateMixin` retained for the two controllers.

### Validation

- `dart format`: passed
- `flutter analyze` (onboarding): 0 issues
- Tests: 220 passed, 87 failed (pre-existing baseline; 0 overflow exceptions, 0 entry failures)

## Changes Made — Creative "Digital Atelier" Entry Screen Redesign

### Modified: `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/screens/entry_screen.dart`

Elevated the first-launch screen into an editorial, art-directed experience while
keeping all routes, behavior, and the value-first + account-gate flow intact.

**Design changes:**
- **Ambient backdrop**: two large radial gold `_GlowOrb`s + 4 scattered `_Star`s
  behind the content, breathing via a looping `_glowController`.
- **Logo badge**: pill tag "AI APPEARANCE INTELLIGENCE" (gold dot) above a large
  serif FANSIVIBE wordmark.
- **Hero visual** (new): a 232px "analysis viewfinder" card with corner brackets
  (`_CornerPainter`), a live gold aura gauge (`_AuraPainter`, 64% arc with a
  pulsing end dot driven by the glow animation), sparkle icons, and a circular
  silhouette avatar — arriving with an `easeOutBack` scale-in.
- **Headline**: serif "Know your **style** *before you dress.*" with "style" in
  italic gold.
- **Manifesto**: three diamond-bulleted lines — Look better. / Dress smarter. /
  Build confidence.
- **Support copy** replaced with AI-powered style/grooming/color line.
- **Account gate**: now a glass `surfaceContainerLow` card (`mdBorder` + hairline
  outline) holding "Do you already have a Fansivibe account?" with `Sign In` /
  `New Here` pill buttons.
- All tokens (`FansivibeColors/Typography/Spacing/Radius`) only; responsive
  `LayoutBuilder` + staggered animations preserved.

**Bug fix**: switched State mixin from `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` →
`TickerProviderStateMixin` (two controllers now run).

### Validation

- `dart format`: passed
- `flutter analyze` (onboarding): 0 issues
- Tests: 220 passed, 87 failed (same pre-existing baseline, no entry-related failures)

## Changes Made — Value-First Entry Screen & Returning-User Gate

### Modified: `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/screens/entry_screen.dart`

Redesigned the first-launch screen to lead with the value proposition instead of
a generic "Get Started" (already value-led, now a full visual redesign).

**Design changes:**
- **Headline**: "AI-powered Style, Grooming & Appearance Intelligence"
- **Value statements**: "Look better. / Dress smarter. / Build confidence." (gold
  editorial lines) + one-line supporting copy
- **Removed** the old `_HeroIllustration` graphic → minimal text-forward layout
- **Primary CTA**: `Analyze My Style` → photo path (`vibeSelect`, `photoPath: true`)
- **Secondary CTA**: `Explore Without Scanning` → light path (`photoPath: false`) — kept
- **Account gate** (new, replaces old Sign In section): "Do you already have a
  Fansivibe account?" with two side-by-side buttons:
  - `Sign In` → Home (mock, unchanged)
  - `Continue as New User` → photo path (same route as Analyze My Style)
- **Privacy note** retained at bottom; staggered entrance animations, design
  tokens (`FansivibeColors/Typography/Spacing/Radius`), and responsive
  `LayoutBuilder` layout preserved.

**No routing changes** — the gate lives on the Entry screen itself; save step
still routes straight to `AccountCreationScreen`.

### Validation

- `dart format`: passed
- `flutter analyze` (onboarding): 0 issues
- Tests: 220 passed, 87 failed (same pre-existing baseline, no new failures)

## Phase

Implemented the complete onboarding experience as a dedicated feature
(`lib/features/onboarding/`). 9 screens + personalized Home first-visit state,
replacing the single Entry screen placeholder. 2,836 lines of new Flutter code.

Onboarding was designed as a 4-act journey:
- **Act 1: Awakening** — Splash → Entry → Vibe Select
- **Act 2: Trust** — Camera Permission → Photo Capture
- **Act 3: Value** — AI Analysis → Your Analysis (score + DNA + AI Progress)
- **Act 4: Commitment** — Account Creation → Personalized Home

Supports two paths: photo path (9 screens → Home) and light path (4 screens → Home).

Previously redesigned 7 core screens with modern visual treatment while preserving all
functionality, navigation, and state management.

| Screen | Change |
|--------|--------|
| **Stylist** | Dashboard-style: hero header + 2×2 action grid + full-width Event Planning tile. Removed `SectionTitle` import. |
| **Home** → `TodaysLookCard` | Redesigned as premium editorial card with 65/35 split: large edge-to-edge image (width-square) with gradient overlay, floating score badge (top-right), "TODAY'S LOOK" label (top-left), weather/occasion overlay (bottom-left); bottom section uses `surfaceContainer` tonal layer with serif editorial title, score pill, one-line description, garment chips, and two equal-width CTAs. Removed `FansivibeCard` wrapper. Uses `LayoutBuilder` for responsive sizing. `ClipRRect` with `mdBorder` for rounded corners. |
| **Home** → `StyleStreakCard` | Flame pill badge (orange 7+ streak, gold otherwise) + week-path timeline with gold connectors + 3 stat badges (Current/Best/Total). Removed `HomeProgressRing`/`StreakDayIndicator`. |
| **Home** → `QuickActionCard` | Fixed 76px tile with 4px accent bar, compact 44×44 icon, centered text, subtle chevron. Uses `FansivibeRadius` tokens. |
| **Discover** → filter | Replaced 3 chip rows with single filter button (50×50, `tune_rounded` icon + badge count) → `_FilterSheet` modal bottom sheet. |
| **Discover** → `LookCard` | Image area with category icon overlay + `FansiBadge` + compact tag row + wardrobe match pill. |
| **Profile** | `ProfileHeroCard` (avatar, name, level badge, XP bar, Score/Rank + date) + `AchievementBar` (horizontal scroll) + combined Style DNA / Saved Looks card + menu card. |
| **Wardrobe** | Premium luxury digital wardrobe: editorial "My Wardrobe" serif header with favorites pill, style-type chip + item count, glassmorphism search bar, icon-only Filter/Sort buttons; `WardrobeDashboardHeader` removed stat tiles in favor of compact header; `CategoryTile` changed to horizontal rounded pills (gold gradient active, tonal inactive) with count badge; `ClothingItemCard` redesigned as 65/35 fashion card with gradient overlay, floating favorite/material badges, quick action icons, fade/scale press animation; `WardrobeInsightCard` compacted with reduced padding; removed `FansivibeCard` import. Preserves all state, filtering, navigation. |

All redesigns use `FansivibeRadius` and `FansivibeColors` semantic tokens,
follow `LayoutBuilder` responsive layout with `contentMaxWidth: 520`, and
preserve original data flow, navigation, and state. All use `FansivibeTypography`, `FansivibeSpacing` tokens.

## Repository Facts

- **Flutter project at**: `newproject/flutter_application_1`
- **Dart files**: 62 (`lib/`) + 25 (`test/`)
- **Total lines**: ~21,000
- **Features**: 10 (`home`, `discover`, `stylist`, `wardrobe`, `outfit_scan`, `outfit_builder`, `hairstyle`, `grooming`, `events`, `profile`)
- **Mock data files**: 10 (`data/` directories across features)
- **Shared widgets**: 7 files (`fansi_button.dart`, `fansi_badge.dart`, `fansi_chip.dart`, `fansivibe_card.dart`, `section_title.dart`, `score_colors.dart`, `icon_utils.dart`)
- **Home-specific widgets removed**: `HomeActionButton`, `OutfitItemChip`, `HomeProgressRing`, `StreakDayIndicator`
- **Theme files**: 2 (`fansivibe_colors.dart`, `fansivibe_theme.dart`)
- **Router**: `go_router` 17.2.3 with `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack`, named routes in `RouteNames`, centralized in `app_router.dart`
- **No state management**: All state is local `setState` in widgets
- **No domain layer**: No `domain/` directory in any feature
- **No assets**: No images, fonts, or asset directories configured

## Routing Architecture

- `lib/app/router/route_names.dart` — all route name string constants
- `lib/app/router/app_router.dart` — single `GoRouter` config with `StatefulShellRoute.indexedStack`
- `lib/app/router/router_shell.dart` — `RouterShell` widget wrapping `StatefulNavigationShell`
- `lib/app/app.dart` — uses `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: appRouter)`
- `lib/app/main_shell.dart` — legacy shell (still present as fallback, not used by router)

5 branches: `/home`, `/discover`, `/stylist`, `/wardrobe`, `/profile`.
Sub-routes nested under `/stylist` and `/wardrobe` for all detail/scan/result screens.

Data passed via `state.extra` as typed objects or `Map<String, String>`.
Route builders null-check `state.extra` to handle GoRouter eager evaluation.

## Implemented Screens

All screens from `docs/SCREEN_MAP.md`, plus new onboarding screens:

### Onboarding (ONB-001 through ONB-009)
- ONB-001: SplashScreen (brand reveal, auto-transitions to Entry)
- ONB-002: EntryScreen (enhanced from original ENTRY-001, value prop + photo/light path fork)
- ONB-003: VibeSelectScreen ("Which style feels most like you?" with 6 editorial cards)
- ONB-005: CameraPermissionScreen (trust-building prior to camera access)
- ONB-006: PhotoCaptureScreen (full-screen camera with guided framing)
- ONB-007: AiAnalysisScreen (atmospheric processing with particles + gold arc)
- ONB-008: YourAnalysisScreen (emotional peak: score + DNA + insights + AI Progress)
- ONB-009: AccountCreationScreen (glass inputs, social login, "Save Locally" option)

### Existing screens (updated)
- HOME-001: HomeScreen (now accepts onboarding data; shows Style DNA card, AI Progress section, light-path prompt on first visit)
- DISCOVER-001: DiscoverScreen (search, filters, tabs, grid)
- DISCOVER-002: LookDetailsScreen (match score, reasons, ensemble, alternatives)
- STYLIST-001: StylistScreen (5 action cards)
- WARDROBE-001: WardrobeScreen (categories, item grid, add item)
- WARDROBE-002: AddWardrobeCategoryScreen
- WARDROBE-003: AddWardrobeItemScreen
- WARDROBE-004: WardrobeItemDetailsScreen

- GROOM-002: GroomingProcessingScreen
- GROOM-003: GroomingResultScreen
- GROOM-004: GroomingDetailsScreen
- EVENT-001: EventListScreen
- EVENT-002: AddEventScreen
- EVENT-003: EventDetailsScreen
- PROFILE-001: ProfileScreen
- PROFILE-002: PreferencesScreen (style preferences with selectable option chips)
- PROFILE-003: SavedLooksScreen (list of saved looks with scores and items)
- PROFILE-004: SubscriptionScreen (Free/Premium/Elite plan cards)
- PROFILE-005: SupportScreen (help topics and contact card)
- PROFILE-006: SettingsScreen (toggles for notifications, sound, haptic, etc.)

## Route Changes

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| `initialLocation` | `/entry` (unchanged — splash is entry screen's opening animation) |
| New routes | `/splash`, `/onboarding/vibe`, `/onboarding/camera-permission`, `/onboarding/photo-capture`, `/onboarding/analysis`, `/onboarding/result`, `/onboarding/account` |
| Route names added | `splash`, `vibeSelect`, `cameraPermission`, `photoCapture`, `aiAnalysis`, `yourAnalysis`, `accountCreation` |
| Home screen | Now accepts `Map<String, dynamic>? onboardingData` for first-visit personalization; delegates to `FirstTimeHomeScreen` when onboarding complete |

## Migration Completed (from previous work)

1. **Router setup**: Added `go_router` 17.2.3 to `pubspec.yaml`. Created
   `lib/app/router/` with `app_router.dart`, `route_names.dart`, `router_shell.dart`.
2. **App entrypoint**: `lib/app/app.dart` switched from `MaterialApp(home: MainShell)`
   to `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: appRouter)`.
3. **Navigation calls**: All `Navigator.push(MaterialPageRoute(...))` in 20+ screen files
   replaced with `context.pushNamed()`/`context.replaceNamed()`.
4. **Cross-feature imports removed**: `stylist_screen.dart` no longer imports 5 screen
   files; `event_details_screen.dart` no longer imports `build_outfit_screen.dart`.
5. **Test updates**: 7 test files updated to use `MaterialApp.router(routerConfig: ...)`
   wrappers for navigation tests.
6. **Route builder null safety**: All `state.extra as T` casts have null-safety fallbacks
   (returns `const SizedBox()` when extra is null) to handle GoRouter 17 eager evaluation.
7. **Test router freshness**: Navigation tests use factory functions returning fresh
   `GoRouter` instances to prevent state leaking across tests.
   `app_router.dart` now exports `appRoutes` (a `List<RouteBase>`) alongside the
   singleton `appRouter` so tests can create isolated routers.

## Changes Made — Today's Look Screen Redesign

### Modified: `lib/features/home/presentation/daily_outfit_screen.dart`

Complete redesign as the "Today's Look" flagship experience using the Digital Atelier design system.

**Design changes:**
- Hero outfit section occupying ~68% of viewport with ambient gradient backdrop
- Floating glass chips overlay using `BackdropFilter` blur: TODAY'S LOOK label, AI Match Score (91%), Occasion, Weather, Confidence Boost
- Editorial summary with outfit name (serif), description, and italic AI selection reason
- Horizontal card carousel for outfit breakdown (The Ensemble) with clothing image area, name, color, category
- "Why It Works" section with 4 glass insight cards: Color Harmony, Body Proportions, Style Compatibility, Occasion Suitability
- Alternative looks horizontal carousel with match scores, style names, and "See Details" CTA
- Quick actions: Wear This Look (primary gold), Generate Another Look, Save Look, Share
- Daily Style Tip editorial card with lightbulb icon
- Staggered entrance animations (7 sections, 2.4s total) with `easeOutCubic`
- Responsive layout with tablet-aware sizing
- Respects `disableAnimations` for reduced motion

**Removed sections from old screen:** Score cards (Match/Style), Style DNA card, Wardrobe Context card, "Change Style" actions, component replace buttons.

### Modified: `lib/features/home/data/daily_outfit_mock_data.dart`

Extended with 3 new model classes and mock data:

- `AlternativeLookData` — id, name, matchScore, styleName for alternatives carousel
- New fields on `DailyOutfitData`: `aiSelectionReason`, `confidenceBoost`, `aiInsights`, `alternatives`, `dailyStyleTip`

### Validation

- `dart analyze`: 0 issues in home feature
- Tests: 23 passed, 0 failed (all daily_outfit_screen tests rewritten for new UI, added 8 new test cases for new sections)

Skill used: `dart-run-static-analysis`

**Sections** (staggered fade + slide animations, 1.8s total):
1. **Hero Greeting** — "Welcome to Fansivibe", personalized name, success message
2. **Hero Card** — Premium gradient container with large Style Score badge (radial glow), Style DNA label, dominant color palette (5 swatch row), and a one-line AI insight
3. **Today's First Recommendation** — Lifestyle card with image area (AI RECOMMENDED tag), content section (title, description, garment chips, "Why this suits you" explanation, "Try This Look" CTA)
4. **Continue Building Your Style** — Expanded capability list (all 7 from `allCapabilities`): active items show checkmark + gold tint; locked items show lock icon + description + unlock hint CTA pill
5. **Quick Actions** — 4 glass-action cards using `BackdropFilter` blur: Scan Another Look, Add Wardrobe, Explore Hairstyles, Discover Style Tips
6. **AI Insight** — Premium insight card with gold gradient border, AI icon, bold insight statement, body text, "Explore Hairstyles" button

**Navigation actions** — Routes to existing screens via `context.pushNamed`/`goNamed`: `dailyOutfit`, `scanOutfit`, `wardrobe`, `hairstyle`, `discover`

**Design tokens** — Uses `FansivibeColors`, `FansivibeTypography`, `FansivibeSpacing`, `FansivibeRadius` exclusively. No hardcoded visual values. Follows the Digital Atelier design system (no borders, tonal layering, `sm`/`md`/`lg` radius, serif headings, sans-serif body, gold accents).

### Modified file: `lib/features/home/presentation/home_screen.dart` (244 lines, -279)

- Early return to `FirstTimeHomeScreen` when `_isFirstVisit && _hasAnalysis`
- Removed 5 unused private classes (`_StyleDNACard`, `_DnaAttribute`, `_ColorDot`, `_AiProgressSection`, `_CompactCapability`)
- Removed `_buildFirstVisitBanner`
- Simplified conditional rendering for light path vs returning user
- Removed unused `onboarding_data.dart` import

## Changes Made — UI Polish & Fixes Round

### Fonts Bundled
- Downloaded and registered **Noto Serif** (variable) and **Inter** (variable) fonts
- Font files at `assets/fonts/NotoSerif-Variable.ttf` and `assets/fonts/Inter-Variable.ttf`
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` with font declarations
- Updated `fansivibe_typography.dart` to use bundled fonts as defaults (was falling back to system serif/sans-serif)

### Hardcoded Colors Replaced
- Replaced all `Color(0xFF4CAF50)` → `FansivibeColors.success` (17 files)
- Replaced all `Color(0xFFFF9800)` → `FansivibeColors.warning` (4 files)
- Replaced all `Color(0xFFF44336)` → `FansivibeColors.error` (4 files)
- Updated `score_colors.dart` utility to use semantic tokens
- Files affected: `profile_widgets.dart`, `look_details_widgets.dart`, `outfit_generation_screen.dart`, `home_widgets.dart`, `outfit_scan_widgets.dart`, `outfit_analysis_screen.dart`, `outfit_processing_screen.dart`, `face_processing_screen.dart`, `hairstyle_details_screen.dart`, `hairstyle_widgets.dart`, `hairstyle_result_screen.dart`, `outfit_recommendation_screen.dart`, `grooming_details_screen.dart`, `grooming_processing_screen.dart`, `grooming_widgets.dart`, `grooming_result_screen.dart`

### Dead Code Removed
- Deleted `lib/app/main_shell.dart` (unused — router uses `router_shell.dart`)
- Deleted `lib/features/entry/` (duplicate pre-onboarding EntryScreen — onboarding version is active)

### Router Error Handling
- Replaced all `const SizedBox()` blank-screen returns (9 occurrences) with `_missingDataScreen()` / `_missingDataScreenWithText()` using `FansiErrorView`
- Files affected: `app_router.dart` (look-details, outfit-generation, hairstyle-details, grooming screens, event-details, wardrobe-add-item, wardrobe-item-details)

### FansivibeCard API Cleanup
- Removed deprecated `borderColor` parameter from `FansivibeCard` (was already documented as "NOT rendered")
- Updated callers: `home_widgets.dart` removed borderColor, `subscription_screen.dart` replaced with `variant` parameter
- Added `CardVariant.high` usage for popular subscription plan

## Remaining Audit Issues

1. **No state management**: All state is local `setState` (not in scope)
2. **No domain layer**: No `domain/` directory in any feature (not in scope)
3. **Stylist string-switch dispatch**: Business logic in UI widgets (not in scope)
4. **Events → Outfit Builder boundary**: No cross-feature contract (not in scope)
5. **87 failing tests**: Same pre-existing issues (home screen onboarding data, entry screen routing). Not introduced by this round.
6. **Mock data**: All onboarding analysis data is currently hardcoded mock values.
    Needs real AI integration.
7. **Photo capture**: Camera/gallery functionality is simulated (placeholder UI).
    Needs platform channel integration.
8. **Splash routing**: Splash screen route exists but initialLocation is `/entry` to
    maintain test compatibility.
9. **Naming inconsistency**: `FansiButton` vs `FansivibeCard` prefix mismatch (deferred).
10. **Mega-widget files**: `home_widgets.dart` (1,277 lines) and others still need splitting (deferred).

## Handoff

New agents must:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read this file.
